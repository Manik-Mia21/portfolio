            <p>I am very fond of making friends all around the world. I have more than fifty friends from other countries.Most of them from the Philippins and Malaysia. I have three friends from the USA , they are Alex and Mark. I do not have any communicatiom with them . During covid-19 i totally stopped cooming online because of my sickness. By the way , even i forget their name but i still miss them. They respected me because the were respected too by me. I think those was just my past memory that happend in my journey.Next i will describe about my pet-Birds(pigeons)</p>
